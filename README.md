# Driver-drowsiness-detection

Drowsiness detection is a safety technology that can prevent accidents that are caused by drivers who fell asleep while driving.

The objective of this intermediate Python project is to build a drowsiness detection system that will detect that a personâ€™s eyes are closed for a few seconds. This system will alert the driver when drowsiness is detected.

Tech Stacks:
- Dlib Library 
- OpenCV
- Streamlit 

# To Run
```
streamlit run app.py
```
